# Example-Codes

Sample codes for various types of bayseian analysis

NOTE: These codes require various large packages (tupak, pycbc, emcee) so installing these packages in a virtual enviroment is highly recommended rather than to a general python. Easiest way is through Conda here: https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html .

Then while in the virtual enviroment use: pip install whatever_package

Open jupyter-notebook while in the virtual enviroment and it should work.
